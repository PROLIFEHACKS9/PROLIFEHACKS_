  <p>
    This section includes LifeHacks for Kids. I've already tried to secure a cup of water colour with a balloon since, as we all know, children are extremely reckless and difficult to alert.it I attempted to do it, and it is so easy and compact that it can be produced by kids or students because the materials are affordable and it takes less than 10 minutes to complete.

		  The materials that are available are only balloons and scissors because cups are usually used and prepared for coloring by children.First, cut the balloon at the end using scissors. And then put the balloon on the face of the cup. Can be ready to use :) <p></p>
			  
<h1>Reminder</h1>
			   <p></p>
		  Additional wording as header reminder in page kids : When it comes to coloring, some kids may struggle with being careless or lack attention to detail. In such cases, providing guided support can be beneficial to help them develop better coloring skills and habits. Here are some strategies that can assist in guiding kids who are careless in coloring:<p></p>

Demonstration and Explanation: Show the child how to color carefully and pay attention to details. Demonstrate techniques such as using light strokes, staying within the lines, and using different shades or colors to add depth and dimension to the coloring page. Explain the importance of taking their time and being mindful of their coloring choices.<p></p>

Break Down the Task: Instead of giving the child an entire coloring page to complete at once, break it down into smaller sections. This approach allows them to focus on one area at a time, reducing the chances of rushing or becoming overwhelmed. Encourage them to take their time and complete each section before moving on.
