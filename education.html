  <h1>EDUCATION</h1>
  <p>
    This part contains LifeHacks for Education. I've already attempted to replace a stapler that is so simple and compact that it can be made by parents, children, or students because the materials are inexpensive and it takes less than 10 minutes to make. I also successfully made a phone stand using paperclips which works really well!

		  As a student who is focused on learning, he is no stranger to paper clips. The question is, by using only paper clips, what can be done to save energy to buy goods and save costs. Equipped with a paperclip only. And only using 2-4 of each production we can produce a standphone or remote to replace a standphone or make a new compartment. First, we fold the existing paper clip from the length to the back and then remove the hook that holds the object that will be held there. After flapping. Try to balance each point balancing object and paper clip. It's ready! Good luck !<p></p>

	Material that we need is just paper. This situation will happen when you are going to compile all the paper section when you are in examinations or doing notes but you have no stapler. 
<p></p>
As be shown in the video, i presented to you the first thing first that we must do is neatly arrange the paper. Then, take the knive make a small line on the top left of the paper. Cut it until reach all pages. 
<p></p>
Then , you can just fold it and put inside the hole. Done! You should try !
